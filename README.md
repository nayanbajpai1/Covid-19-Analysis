## Overview : 
### Problem Statement:
The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions, with varying impacts across different countries. Understanding trends, death rates, recovery rates, and the spread of the virus is critical for managing the pandemic effectively. The goal of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 data, identify key patterns, and build a forecasting model to predict future case trends, specifically focusing on India and global insights.
### Objectives:
- To analyze and understand the global trends of COVID-19, focusing on case counts, death rates, and recovery rates.
- To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in India, including death rates, recovery rates, and active cases.
- To build and assess the performance of a time-series forecasting model (Prophet) to predict future case trends.
- To identify countries with exceptionally high or low death and recovery rates and draw actionable insights for improvement.
- To provide recommendations for controlling the spread and improving recovery based on the analysis of global data.
### Steps:
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Building Forecasting model (Prophet)
### Key Insights:
- Overall Trend: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has shown significant growth over time, with notable peaks.
